Task 2 - UDP
Goal:

Write client and a server program that communicate over UDP socket. 
Client task is to send a file divided into proper size datagrams to the server. 
Server prints out the received data without information about the source.

Each packet send to server must be confirmed with return message. 
If confirmation is missing (wait 0,5 sec.) resend the packet again. 
If 5 tries in a row fail, client program exits with an error. 
Both data packets and confirmations can be lost, program must resolve this issue. 
Server can not print the same part of the file more than once.

All metadata (everything apart from file content) send over the udp socket 
must be converted to int32_t type. You can assume that maximum allowed datagram 
(all data and metadata) size is 576B. Server can handle 5 concurrent transmissions 
at a time. If sixth client tries to send data it should be ignored.

Server program takes port as its sole parameter, client takes address 
and port of the server as well as file name as its parameters.
